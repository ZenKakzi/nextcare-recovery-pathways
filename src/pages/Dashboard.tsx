const ARTICLE1_TITLE = "Eat for a Happy Heart: Delicious Dishes That Keep Your Ticker Ticking";
const ARTICLE1_BODY = `Hello there, proud owner of a heart that needs a bit of VIP treatment!
 If your heart's been feeling a little "meh" thanks to cholesterol, high blood pressure, or everyday life stress, don't worry! Today, I'll take you on a kitchen adventure â€” cooking mouthwatering dishes that'll make your heart dance with joy!
1. Fatty Fish â€“ Get Your Heart Grooving
Top picks: Salmon, mackerel, sardines.

Why it's good: Packed with Omega-3s, which fight inflammation and prevent clogged arteries.

Tasty tips:

Lightly pan-sear with green pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon.
Or wrap it in foil with veggies and a honey glaze for an irresistible oven treat.

2. Avocado â€“ More Than Just a Fancy Guacamole Base
Why it's good: Full of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats that lower bad cholesterol.

Trendy ways to eat:

Mash it into a creamy salad dressing.
Spread on whole-grain toast, sprinkle some chia seeds â€” healthy but make it fashion.
3. Oats â€“ The Breakfast MVP for Heart Health
Why it's good: Rich in beta-glucan, a fiber that lowers cholesterol like a charm.

How to keep it exciting:

Classic oatmeal with fresh fruits and a drizzle of honey.
Overnight oats with almond milk for the busy bees out there.
4. Dark Leafy Greens â€“ Nature's Heart Guardians
Top picks: Spinach, kale, bok choy.

Why it's good: Loaded with natural nitrates that gently lower blood pressure.

Tasty ideas:

Toss into a salad with olive oil.
Lightly stir-fry with garlic (easy on the oil, please!).`;

const ARTICLE2_TITLE = "Busted! Common Heart Disease Myths That Could Literally Break Your Heart";
const ARTICLE2_BODY = `Hey there, my fellow warriors with sensitive little hearts!
 Today, let's bust some urban legends about heart disease that sound convincing... but could actually backfire big time!
1. "I'm strong like an ox â€” no heart problems for me!"
The truth: Heart disease doesn't care how many push-ups you can do. If you chase it down with three bowls of beef noodle soup at midnight... well, good luck, buddy.

2. "Heart disease only happens to old people."
The truth: Not anymore! Thanks to stress, late nights, boba tea, and fried everything, heart disease is getting disturbingly younger.

3. "As long as I take my meds, I can eat anything!"
The truth: Meds help, sure â€” but if your diet is a daily double of fried chicken + double topping milk tea... even your doctor will run out of prayers.
4. "No symptoms = No problem."
The truth: 50% of heart attacks come with zero warning signs. It's like getting ghosted by your crush â€” no notice, just... pain.

ðŸŒŸ Moral of the story:
Don't wait for your heart to scream before you start caring.

Good food + regular exercise = the secret potion for a heart that stays young and happy!`;
